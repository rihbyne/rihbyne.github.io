Summary: This post gives a walk through on a enterprise acclaimed nodejs framework

The below figure is an illustration of sophisticated NodeJS API Framework called loopback, which is used for
building serious service APIs. Loopback is supported and crafted by Strongloop, an IBM company. I have
borrowed the image from the company's site and have added the illustrations on top of it. This picture explains
the framework's modules briefly. The one's in the green are the components which the loopback provides. Also, I
believe this picture will also help you decide whether to use a particular component or not because it has got some
components which even you can write on your own, which is good - gives you control over your code rather than using
the abstract one's which come along with it. However, there are some modules which the framework provides out of
box which abstracts away a lot of biolerplate functionality and therefore they are worth incorporating in your code.
