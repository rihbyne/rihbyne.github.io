Summary: my 40 minute information session in a graduate seminar class discussing essential general concepts that go in designing high-traffic web applications

As a graduate student at [California State University, Channel Islands](https://www.csuci.edu/), we are required to prepare and talk on a suitable topic of interest for an inclass seminar. After going through a lot of options, I made my mind to study and speak on basic tools and concepts applied to build distributed systems for the web. As we all know distributed systems is hard and complex topic, there isn't much literature on how does one logically segment a web service infrastructure onto more than one machine for various reasons. From what I have read, one shouldn't start thinking about this problem if your analysis from system metrics shows no evidence. But if you were to do so, what component of your N tier application would you scale ? after all, not all components require attention and also factor in cost efficiency.
